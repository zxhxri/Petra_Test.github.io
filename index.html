                <p>Anthropometry: <br>The Ornament of Gesture <br>
                    Graduation Project (2018)<br><a name="grad"></a>&#8600;</p>
            </a>

            <div id="smalltext" style="display:none">Design for spatial decorative ornament produced with 100% pure transparent silicone sealant. Applied directly by hand onto plain walls, it blends with space by creating reliefs within the regular surface.<br>100% removable, long-lasting, waterproof add-on for interior.
                <br>In architecture, as well as in interior design, ornaments have played an important role in emphasising, amplifying space but also in creating an organic relation to culture and style. When decoration was a craft, it used to exceed from being just an extra layer in space—thus, it has formally transformed the way we characterise and identify a space. <br>
                In some moral grounds, it has been stated that because of the mass production and its vast growth, the craft of making ornaments became detached from the human gesture, and we simply have grown out of it. The space for improvement or new ideas seem to have blurred, so did the physical connection between the human and the building. <br>
                In this spatial project I am rethinking the impact of gesture as an ornament on architectural space. By showcasing the representative function of the white wall and not perceiving it as a limit to prevent bodies from freedom of movement, the human reconfigures itself as a design tool. With a new methodology of actions, gestural language is translated into an ornament where the body proportions react to the hierarchy of the given space. <br><br>

                In doing so Black Disko Kollektiv, tries to channel the colourful hysteria, surrounding the rise of western populism in order to materialize some kind of unity out of all these contradictory perspectives...’Leftist Art Academy students’, entering the world of ‘dictator-chic’ and ‘decor hardcore’, having fun mirroring symbols of wealth and power.<br><br>

                Loneliness as a state in which being in public does equalise socialising and being among others. Excluding yourself as a matter of choice. Avoiding any contact, lonesome feelings disappear where a stuck position makes you forget who you are. Lonesome meditation corner in an art gallery, two relaxing fish videos, your old lazy boy chair. <br><br>research, concept, installation,video, post-production</div>
